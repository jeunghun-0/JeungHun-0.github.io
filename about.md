Hi, I'm Jeunghun Oh. I'm a Bayesian and a Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistics in Seoul National University. My areas of interests are Bayesian nonparametric function estimation and posterior concentration theories on Bayesian statistcal models.

In my leisurely hours, I read science fictions (mostly), practice boxing or study math.
